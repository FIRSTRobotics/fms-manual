The Data Download step of the Event Wizard is used to download the complete event list of all official *FIRST* Robotics Competition Events and Teams. It will also ensure that the data is up-to-date with any changes the team may have made to their `Team Registration <https://www.firstinspires.org/team-registration-site>`_ profile. Data download should be done at the start of each official competition, and can optionally be done again at a later time to query for any changes that may continue to be made. For example, if a team changes their name in the dashboard, it would need to be retrieved using Data Download (after being processed by *FIRST* HQ) before it would be reflected in reports or across the FMS software.

For more information on how FMS collects and uses data, please see the frc.events `data services <https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/services/data>`_ page.

When applicable, this also downloads all available Team Avatars.

In FMS Off-Season, this step does not download anything, the software installation includes the complete registered team list from the current season.
