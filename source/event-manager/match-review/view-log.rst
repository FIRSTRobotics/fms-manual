Clicking on the "View Log" button below each team number opens a viewer which gives detailed logging information of the team during that particular match.
FMS records data every 500ms for each team in each match. Details include Mode (Auto or Teleop), DS Link, E-stop condition, and if the robot was enabled or disabled,
battery voltage, radio signal level, radio signal-to-noise ratio, and bandwidth usage.

The same data is available via the :ref:`field-monitor-logs-scores` page of the Field Monitor, which is especially useful for allowing Field Staff to review data without interrupting match play.
