Score Tab
===========

Game specific field scoring and adjustments.

Score Tab - Page 1
------------------

.. image:: images/score-tab-0.png

The Score Tab is the primary location used to confirm the score of the match prior to Commit Score. The information shown on this tab is input by the Referees using the Touchscreens or by the automated scoring system (except in FMS Off-Season).
Scoring value can be manually edited through this interface. The total alliance score is automatically recalculated as these adjustments are made. Values are not editable until after the match is over, 
because values come from the Referees or automation during the match. In FMS Off-Season, values are editable during the match as there are no Referee panels or real time automation.

.. note::
    Be careful if you elect to manually score, or edit scores, using the score tab

Documentation will reference the blue Alliance, but the functionality is the same for the red Alliance. At official *FIRST* events, all of the data on the score tab comes from automated hardware or certified Referees.
The scorekeeper should not edit any values without the supervision and direction of the Head Referee.

** 2023 Score Tab Detail Coming Soon **

* Notice that Foul Pts are points credited to the alliance, which means they're calculated off the other alliance's violations. Changing the Foul/TechFoul counts on a given alliance will change the score of the *opposite* alliance.


Referee Completion Warning
--------------------------

If a Scorekeeper attempts to Commit a score before the Referees have completed their scoring of the match, a warning dialog will be presented.

Missing Hardware Warning
------------------------

** Image Coming Soon **

During official events, if FMS believes that scoring hardware is unavailable, it will add a warning message to the corresponding elements. Hover text is available on most elements and provides additional detail.

Post-Match Comments
-------------------

.. image:: images/score-tab-4.png

If a match is edited by the scorekeeper after the clock expires, or any cards were assigned in the match, a comment window is automatically opened when the Commit button is pressed on the FCUI.
This box can be used for comments regarding why the score was edited after the match ended and these comments will be saved and available later, should a review be necessary.
The box can also be manually requested using the dropdown arrow on the commit button in the FCUI.
