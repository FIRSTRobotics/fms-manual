The bracket display is used during the Playoff tournament to guide teams and the audience through the playoff tournament.

.. note::
   The double elimintation bracket is new in 2023. The bracket view is critical to keeping everyone in the venue aware 
   of the progression through the playoffs- please coordinate with the announcer/emcee to display the bracket at the 
   conclusion of each match.

Break
-------

The break timing display is available during both Qualification and Playoff matches, though is typically only used in Playoffs when between matches.
The display contains the match number or phase (e.g. "Test Match") as well as the event name, time remaining and upcoming match data.
Upon timer expiry/cancel, the "buzzer" sound will be played if "sound alerts" were enabled when the break was started by the scoring table.
