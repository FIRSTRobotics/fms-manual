Setting Up Your Event
======================

This article is a supplement to the full documentation. See the full software documentation for detailed instructions about particular elements.

Basic Steps
-----------

* In the event wizard create a new Off-Season event. Select the playoff and event settings you desire.
* In the event wizard select the teams participating in the event. Additional teams may be added if necessary at a later time. Even though team WPA keys are not used click Generate Security Keys before leaving this step (Match Play will require keys to exist in the database)
* Continue with schedule creation and generation as at a regular event, using the FMS User’s Guide for assistance as needed.

Since off season events are not using the full set of FMS electronics, the Field Monitor (Website) and Status (FMS) screens will always show Red for the DS-ETH state indicator (X) and 0.000 for the BWU value as they are not available.
