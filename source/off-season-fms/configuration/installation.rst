.. image:: images/installation-7.png

The Audience Display should run properly with no advanced configuration. You only need to follow these instructions if you encountered trouble running the program out of the box.

If you have trouble running the Audience Display in its default configuration, you may need to use compatibility mode. Open the location where you installed FMS, which is usually something similar to:

.. code-block:: text

    C:\Program Files (x86)\FIRST\AudienceDisplayExeOffseason (64 bit OS)

Right click on AudienceDisplay.exe and select Properties. Under Compatibility, select “Run this program in compatibility mode” and pick “Windows XP (Service Pack 3)” from the dropdown box.

Select OK. When you re-launch the Audience Display using the shortcut on your desktop, it should run properly.

It’s also possible to run the audience display remotely. If you wish to do so, please see the appropriate configuration instructions in the User’s Guide. It is recommended to run no more than two (2) instances of the Audience Display at any given time.

Advanced Installation
---------------------

By default, FMS will use port 80 (localhost) for its Web Portal. However, this can be changed if you need FMS to use another port. Notice: The documentation references port 80 in examples. If you install on another port, you would need to change the references in the documentation to match.

Using a command line, navigate to the folder which contains the FMS Off-Season Installer. The only user-configurable installation option for FMS is WebSitePort. Invoke the installer with the WebSitePort argument specifying the port you would like to use. For example, to invoke the installer with the default port (80) you would use the following command (you may need to change the name of the .exe file in this example):

FMSOffSeasonInstaller.exe WebSitePort=80

Proceed with the installation as described previously.

Shutting Down
-------------

To shut down the "FMS" application, simply click the "X" in the upper right. Only do this if a match is not running.

To shut down the "Audience Display" application, simply click "Alt+F4" when the application is in the foreground. Alternately, right click on the icon in the taskbar and selecting "Close Window."
