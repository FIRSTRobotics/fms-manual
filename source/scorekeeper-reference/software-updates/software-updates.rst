Software Updates
======================

Overview
--------

The Field Management System (FMS) is the electronics core of a *FIRST* Robotics Competition (FRC) playing field and encompasses both
hardware and software components. Updates are released periodically, some publicly and some privately to official *FIRST* events.

Some Volunteers, such as Scorekeepers, may be granted access to downloads of FMS updates for personal user / training. Consult your *FIRST* point of contact for more information.
