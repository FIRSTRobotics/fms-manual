Qualification (Day 2) and Alliance Selection (Day 3)
=====================================================

At most all events Qualification matches occur over more than one day; typically qualification runs for one full day and up through lunch on the second day.
The Qualification Schedule is generated on the day preceding the beginning of Qualification, if possible. It is extremely important that all teams on the
Qualification Schedule are present and will be participating in the Qualification matches. If one or more teams that are appearing on the Qualification Schedule leave
the tournament prior to the start of the Qualification matches, the Qualification Schedule should be regenerated to remove the missing team(s).
Work with your FTA to ensure all teams participating are present and ready.

Qualification
-------------

#. Check in with the FTA.
#. Launch the FMS Event Manager software (if not already loaded).

   * Check with HQ Support to determine if any FMS updates or other software updates/maintenance is required.

#. On the Audience Display Toughbook, load the Audience Display software (if not already loaded). For additional information about how to configure the Audience Display, see the corresponding section in the :ref:`the setup step <scorekeeper-setup>`
#. Run a Test Match to confirm all field components operate correctly. This process should be coordinated with the FTA. This may be an abbreviated version of the test conducted during Setup depending on the time available and FTA preferences.
#. Make sure the Qualification Schedule is activated within the Event Wizard.
#. Export the Qualification Schedule in Excel format for the Match Observer judges. The Match Observer judges will bring a USB Flash Drive to the scoring table once the Qualification schedule has been created (likely before), please save a copy of the qualification schedule in Excel format to their USB Flash Drive.
#. Print a copy of the Award Eligibility Report for the judges.
#. Work with your FTA and Game Announcer to determine if the electronic GA Tool will be used.

   * If the GA Tool is not being used, generate and print the Announcer's Report for Qualification Matches.

#. Print the Qualification Match schedule, if not done already
#. It may be necessary to select the first Qualification Match in the schedule before prestarting the first match.
#. Once all robots link to the field, the green LEDs turn off only if you're in "Set Audience Display." "Set Audience Display" is also required in order for the Field Stack Light to turn Green.
#. Play the Qualification Schedule

#. When you reach the end of Qualification Day 1:

   * Use the "Settings" button, "Backup" tab, "Force Event Backup" button to ensure the event database is backed up.
   * For three-day Regional events only, load in the Friday Award winners.

      * Navigate to Award Assignment step in the Event Wizard
      * If the Judge Advisor has uploaded the awards, you can click "Download Judge's Award Assignments" otherwise you will need to enter the award assignments manually.

   * During the Awards Ceremony, put the field lights into "Awards Mode."
   * Check with the FTA to determine if power will remain on or will be shut off overnight. If power to the field will be turned off, shutdown the Scorpion server with direction from the FTA. Otherwise, put the field in Night Mode.

#. When you reach the end of Qualification Matches (and are headed into Alliance Selection):

   * Using the Options tab in Match Play select "Recalculate Rankings" for the qualification matches
   * Use the "Settings" button, "Backup" tab, "Force Event Backup" button to ensure the event database is backed up.
   * Print the Qualifications Ranking report for the Announcer and Emcee as soon as the final qualification match has completed.
   * Use the Alliance Selection step in the Event Wizard to set alliances as they are picked. 
   * Use the video switcher on the alliance wizard step to select the Alliance Selection display onto the audience screens during the Alliance Selection ceremony.
   * Verify what time the Playoff matches will start with your FTA so that the schedule can be constructed as soon as alliances have been selected

#. Immediately following the Alliance Selection process, quickly build the playoff schedule so that the Backup Robots report and Playoff Coupon report can be printed out. Verify that the cycle time is set to 9 minutes.

   * All that needs to be known is the time which Playoff matches will begin, and the number of matches in playoffs is always the same. Matchmaker is not used in Playoff Match Generation.
   * The Backup Robot report must go to the Head Referee immediately (so that they can hand it to another Referee or Queue staff to handle backup robot acceptance)
   * The Playoff Coupons and Lineups are to be distributed to alliance captains (via the Head Referee). They will need the following items (cut and ready for them): Playoff Coupons, Lineup Cards, 8 Schedules and 8 Brackets
   * Keep the Backup Robot report in a safe spot near you once it has been returned by the Referees (which may not be until after lunch)
   * Print some additional Brackets and Schedules for queuing and field staff

#. Activate the Playoff Match Schedule.
#. Print Playoff Schedules and initial Announcer reports if the GA tool is not being used (save the paper if you can!)
#. Before you leave for lunch, use the video switcher to display the Bracket
