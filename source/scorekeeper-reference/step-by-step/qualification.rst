Qualification (Day 2/3)
=========================

At most all events, Qualification occurs over more than one day; typically qualification runs for one full day and up through lunch on the second day. The Qualification Schedule is generated on the day preceding the beginning of Qualification, if possible. It is extremely important that all teams on the Qualification Schedule are present and will be participating in the Qualification matches. If one or more teams that are appearing on the Qualification Schedule leave the tournament prior to the start of the Qualification matches, the Qualification Schedule should be regenerated to remove the missing team(s). Work with your FTA to ensure all teams participating are present and ready.

Qualification
-------------

#. Check in with the FTA.
#. Launch the FMS Event Manager software (if not already loaded).

   * Check with HQ Support to determine if any FMS updates or other software updates/maintenance is required.

#. On the Audience Display Toughbook, load the Audience Display software (if not already loaded).

   * If an FMS update was required, you will also need to update the Audience Display. This can be done using the “Check for Updates” button within the Audience Display configuration panel.
   * If the Audience Display application is not already on the computer, connect to the FMS Network and navigate to http://10.0.100.5/FRCDownloads where you can download the current Audience Display installer.
   * A/V or Webcast may need to run their own Audience Display. They can follow the same process to get an up-to-date version of the Audience Display
   * Once the Audience Display software has been launched, configure the display(s) using the following hotkey combinations.

#. Run a Test Match to confirm all field components operate correctly. This process should be coordinated with the FTA. This may be an abbreviated version of the test conducted during Setup depending on the time available and FTA preferences.
#. Make sure the Qualification Schedule is activated within the Event Wizard.
#. Export the Qualification Schedule in Excel format for the Match Observer judges. The Match Observer judges will bring a USB Flash Drive to the scoring table once the Qualification schedule has been created (likely before), please save a copy of the qualification schedule in Excel format to their USB Flash Drive.
#. Print a copy of the Award Eligibility Report for the judges.
#. Work with your FTA and Game Announcer to determine if the electronic GA Tool will be used.

   * If the GA Tool is not being used, generate and print the Announcer's Report for Qualification Matches.

#. Print the Qualification Match schedule, if not done already
#. It may be necessary to select the first Qualification Match in the schedule before prestarting the first match.
#. Once all robots link to the field, the green LEDs turn off only if you're in “Set Audience Display.” “Set Audience Display” is also required in order for the Field Stack Light to turn Green.
#. End of Qualification Day 1

   * Use the “Settings” button, “Backup Config” tab, “Force Event Backup” button to ensure the event database is backed up.
   * For three-day Regional events only, load in the Friday Award winners.

      * Navigate to Step 11 in the Event Wizard
      * If the Judge Advisor has uploaded the awards, you can click “Download Judge's Award Assignments” otherwise you will need to enter the award assignments manually.

   * During the Awards Ceremony, put the field lights into “Awards Mode.”
   * Check with the FTA to determine if power will remain on or will be shut off overnight. If power to the field will be turned off, shutdown the Scorpion server with direction from the FTA. Otherwise, put the field in Night Mode.

#. End of Qualifications (to Alliance Selection). 
#. Use the “Settings” button, “Backup Config” tab, “Force Event Backup” button to ensure the event database is backed up.
#. Print the Qualifications Ranking report for the Announcer as soon as the final qualification match has completed.
#. Use the Alliance Selection (Step 12) in the Event Wizard to set alliances as they are picked. 

   * Use the video switcher at the bottom of the screen to select between the “Alliance” and “Available Teams” audience screens during the Alliance Selection ceremony.

#. Immediately following the Alliance Selection process, quickly build the playoff schedule so that the Backup Robots report and Playoff Coupon report can be printed out.

   * All that needs to be known is the time which Playoff matches will begin, and the number of matches in playoffs is always 16. Matchmaker is not used in Playoff Match Generation.
   * The Backup Robot report must go to the HEAD REFEREE immediately (so that they can hand it to another Referee or Queue staff to handle backup robot acceptance) and the Playoff Coupons are to be distributed to alliance captains.

#. Activate the Playoff Match Schedule (Event Wizard Step 14).
#. Print Playoff Schedules and initial Announcer reports if the GA tool is not being used.
#. Before you leave for lunch, use the video switcher to either display the Quarterfinal bracket or use the Messages tab to put a lunch message (using the Background view).
