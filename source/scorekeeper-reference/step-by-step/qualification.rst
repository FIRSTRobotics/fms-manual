Qualification (Day 2)
=====================

Determine seeding for Playoff matches

Qualification
-------------

At most all events, Qualification occurs over more than one day; typically qualification runs for one full day and up through lunch on the second day. The Qualification Schedule is generated on the day preceding the beginning of Qualification, if possible. It is extremely important that all teams on the Qualification Schedule are present and will be participating in the Qualification matches. If one or more teams that are appearing on the Qualification Schedule leave the tournament prior to the start of the Qualification matches, the Qualification Schedule should be regenerated to remove the missing team(s). Work with your FTA to ensure all teams participating are present and ready.

#. Check in with the FTA.
#. Launch the FMS Event Manager software (if not already loaded) Check with HQ Support to determine if any FMS updates or other software updates/maintenance is required.

      #. Install the Audience Display application on the local computer.

#. Run a Test Match and confirm all field components operate correctly. This process should be coordinated with the FTA. This may be an abbreviated version of the test conducted during Setup depending on the time available and FTA preferences.
#. Make sure the Qualification Schedule is activated within the Event Wizard.
#. Export the Qualification Schedule in Excel format for the Match Observer judges. The Match Observer judges will bring a USB Flash Drive to the scoring table once the Qualification schedule has been created (likely before), please save a copy of the qualification schedule in Excel format to their USB Flash Drive.
#. Print a copy of the Award Eligibility Report for the judges. This report can actually be printed at any time AFTER the schedule has been created, but it must be printed for the judges. The judges will come by the scoring table, and having it printed out ahead of time is a great way to say "thank you in advance for providing me a copy of the awards!"
#. Generate and print the Announcer’s Report for Qualification Matches.
#. Print the Qualification Match schedule, if not done already
#. It may be necessary to select the first Qual match in the schedule before prestarting the first match. It’s not that we don’t trust you, but only Santa knows if you’re being naughty or nice.
#. Once all robots link to the field, the Power Port LEDs turn off ONLY if you’re in “Set Audience Display.” “Set Audience Display” is also required in order for the Field Stack Light to turn Green. Also note that ball jams or other obstructions in the ball counters will also affect the Amber stack lights. The Amber stack light will flash along with the color light of the corresponding alliance that the jam is occurring on. If the Amber light flashes by itself, it means that the Ref Panels are taking too long to submit after a match.

During the Awards Ceremony, put the field lights into “Awards Mode.” Check with the FTA to determine if power will remain on or will be shut off overnight. If power to the field will be turned off, shutdown the Scorpion server with direction from the FTA. If powered, put the field lights into “Night Mode.”

#. End of Qualifications (to Alliance Selection) Use the “Settings” button, “Backup Config” tab, “Force Event Backup” button to ensure the event database is backed up. Print the Qualifications Ranking report for the Announcer as soon as the final qualification match has completed. Use the Alliance Selection (Step 12) in the Event Wizard to set alliances as they are picked. Use the video switcher at the bottom of the screen to select between the “Alliance” and “Available Teams” audience screens during the Alliance Selection ceremony. Try not to roll your eyes too loudly when someone “graciously accepts.” Immediately following Alliance Selection process, the playoff schedule must be built VERY QUICKLY so that the Backup Robots report and Playoff Coupon report can be printed out. The Backup Robot report must go to the HEAD REFEREE immediately (so that they can hand it to another Referee or Queue staff to handle backup robot acceptance) and the Playoff Coupon report should be cut up along dotted lines so that the teams will have Timeout and Backup coupons. Build the Playoff Schedule (Event Wizard Step 13). All that needs to be known is the time which Playoff matches will begin, and the number of matches in playoffs is always 21. Matchmaker is not used in Playoff Match Generation. Activate the Playoff Match Schedule (Event Wizard Step 14). Print Backup Robots Report, Playoff Schedules, Backup and Timeout coupons, and initial Announcer reports (only the pages that pertain to the Quarterfinals). Before you leave for lunch, use the video switcher to either display the Quarterfinal bracket or use the Messages tab to put a lunch message (using the Background view).
