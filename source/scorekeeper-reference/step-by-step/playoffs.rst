Playoffs (Day 3)
======================

Playoffs are a double-elimination tournament consisting of six rounds. After each round, new schedules (for queue staff) and Announcer report (unless the GA Tool is in use) should be printed.

Playoffs Process
-------------------

Stay calm, stay hydrated, enjoy the matches. You've got the best seat in the house!

#. If the Announcer is not using the electronic GA Tool, Announcer Reports should be printed at the beginning of each round.
#. Limited numbers of schedules should be reprinted for queue staff and essential personnel at the beginning of each round.
#. Bracket Reports should be printed for the Head Referee and Game Announcer as needed.
#. Field Breaks should be employed between rounds as follows:

   * 6-minute Break after rounds 3 and 4
   * 15-minute Awards Break after remaining rounds and between finals matches
   * Timers should start as soon as the field is cleared (or as soon as scores are posted if delayed by ref discussions)
   * Coordination may need to be organized between the scoring table and additional A/V staff to make sure the timer bar is visible on screen when the timer is running.

#. Alliance Captains should be submitting lineup cards directly to the Head Ref (or their designee) more than 2 minutes before match start.

   * The Head Ref should identify a lineup card designee to Alliance Captains during their meeting after alliance selection.
   * It is on the Alliance Captains to deliver them to the right person & one-time.
   * Head Ref display shows the countdown to 2-minute mark in the bottom right corner - and the accepting back-up robot coupon / lineup card boxes in the bottom right. As someone keeping an eye on match flow - it is good for scorekeepers to make sure the timer was started between matches.
   * Lineup Cards need to be kept confidential until Match Pre-Start occurs
   * If no lineup card was submitted in time for the next match - alliances default to their most recently submitted lineup card
   * If no lineup has yet been submitted in eliminations - default station positions are Station 1 - First Alliance Pick, Station 2 - Alliance Captain, Station 3 - Second Alliance Pick
   * Suggestions for keeping lineup cards organized are to keep one pile of most recent lineup cards (one per alliance) face down on desk. As teams submit new lineups or are eliminated the previous/no longer needed lineups can be folded or have a notch torn in them and placed in a second pile or paper clipped together. In case they need to be referenced later.
   * Also good idea to verify/add match# you first used it to each lineup card if the alliance captain wasn't clear in what they wrote.

#. If an Alliance submits a backup robot coupon - they get the first available robot that signed their agreement to be a backup bot.

   * The backup robot coupon should come with a new lineup card and also be delivered to the Head Ref or their designee.
   * The Head Ref/FTA will probably ask about who is first on the list before the coupon is officially submitted to the scoring table for use.
   * Return to Event Wizard and Select Alliance Membership before prestarting the match where the new robot will be coming in.
   * Select radio button next to the team subbing out and enter the backup team number into the Round 3 / Backup slot.
   * Select "Save Alliances" and once you verify changes - return to match play.

#. In case of a tie during eliminations - the tiebreakers found in the Tournament section of the Game Manual should be utilized by the Head Ref
#. Awards will be announced during 15-minute awards breaks after round 4, 5, and between finals matches.

   * Before leaving Match Play select "Start Break" on the FCUI, and make sure the audio is deselected (so it does not sound the horn during the awards ceremony)
   * Open the Event Wizard and navigate to the award assignment step
   * Set the field the Awards Mode
   * Follow along with the Awards Ceremony and display awards accordingly
   * Return Match Play after Awards are complete
   * Note: FMS will automatically populate the Winners and Finalists once they have been determined
