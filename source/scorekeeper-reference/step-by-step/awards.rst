Awards
======================

Awards are a key component of the *FIRST* Robotics Competition and each event's Closing Ceremonies. Take care to maintain confidentiality throughout the awards processes.

Awards Process
----------------

* Awards must be entered into FMS prior to the presentation of any awards. Navigate to Award Assignment step of the Event Wizard, where there are two methods for award entry.

   * The preferred and most common award entry method is through the Judge Advisor portal. If the Judge Advisor has submitted awards through the Portal, you can fetch the award assignments by clicking on "Download Judge's Award Assignments"
   * In cases where the Judge Advisor is unable to submit award assignments, you will have to revert to manual entry.

   .. important::
      Be careful to prevent wandering eyes from accessing the awards, make sure to pay attention to all warning boxes when entering or displaying awards, and do not post the awards nor submit them prior to their official announcement. 
      Awards that are submitted are immediately posted online and are available via the *FIRST* API and website.

* Once ALL awards are complete, select the "Public?" boxes next to each award and click "Upload Award Assignments"
