Awards
======================

Awards are a key component of the *FIRST*\ |reg| Robotics Competition and each event's Closing Ceremonies. Take care to maintain confidentiality throughout the awards processes.

Awards Process
----------------

#. Awards must be entered into FMS prior to the presentation of any awards. Navigate to Step 16 of the Event Wizard, where there are two methods for award entry.

   * The preferred and most common award entry method is through the Judge Advisor portal. If the Judge Advisor has submitted awards through the Portal, you can fetch the award assignments by clicking on “Download Judge's Award Assignments”
   * In the rare event that the Judge Advisor is unable to submit award assignments, you will have to revert to manual entry.

   .. important::
      Be careful to prevent wandering eyes from accessing the awards, make sure to pay attention to all warning boxes when entering or displaying awards, and do not post the awards nor submit them prior to their official announcement. awards that are submitted are immediately posted online and are available via the *FIRST*\ |reg| API and online.

#. [Regional Events Only] Once all awards are entered move on to the Wildcard step and ensure that there are four (4) green checkmarks. Once verified, click “Calculate Wildcards” to allow the system to calculate wildcards.

   * If a Wildcard is generated, navigate to the Reports area and print the Wildcard Script via the “Wildcard Script” under “Other Event Reports”.

#. [ALL EVENTS] Once ALL awards are complete, select the POST boxes next to each award and click “Upload Award Assignments.”
