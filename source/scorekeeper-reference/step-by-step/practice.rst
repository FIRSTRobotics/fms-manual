Practice (Day 1)
================

Prepare the teams for official matches

Practice
--------

During Practice, teams will come to the Practice Field and run their robots according to a set Practice Schedule. The actual schedule isn’t “set in stone”, and different event types (Regional vs District) will run Practice differently. It’s recommended to run all Practice matches within a Practice schedule to allow the FMS to log match data and robot data so that FTAs and HQ can examine robot and/or field problems through the match logs.
