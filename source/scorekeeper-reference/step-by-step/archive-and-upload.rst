Archive and Upload
======================

This is the very last step you should perform on the server. Before doing this, ensure your awards are completed, you've checked with your FTA, and most importantly contact your HQ support person and ask if there's any other tasks to perform. Once you complete the upload step, it's difficult to go back and do anything else as this completes and closes out the event.

Event Upload Process
---------------------

#. If, and only if, the support person gives you the go-ahead, perform the “Upload Event Data” step by clicking the button.
#. Once the upload is showing completed, check in with your FRC Support person. The support team needs to verify that they received the upload. Support may need to remote into the system to perform a backup manually if the operation fails, so please stay near.
#. Once they're done, and have verified that everything is good, you can close all applications and log off and shut down the server.
#. Assist with Field Teardown and Loadout, if possible.

Thank YOU!
