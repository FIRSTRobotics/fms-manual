Purpose
-------

The purpose of this "Scorekeepers Reference" section (including the step-by-step) is to give FRC\ |reg| Scorekeeping volunteers a handy reference guide and materials to supplement the more detailed information that can be found in the full User's Guide.

It may be of help to Off-Season events, but is designed for official in-season events.

"Days" designed are assuming a regional schedule (typical regional) and may not apply to a condensed (district) schedule.

Overview
--------

The Field Management System (FMS) is the electronics core of a *FIRST*\ |reg| Robotics Competition (FRC) playing field and encompasses both hardware and software components. The software package is used to control all the field electronics (LED Displays, Station Control Cabinets, E-stops, enable/disable of the Robots, network security, etc.) and is used to manage the event by creating match schedules, scoring the matches in real-time, and posting information to the Audience screen. The Scorekeeper, with direction and guidance from the FTA, manages the FMS during an FRC event. This document IS NOT an exhaustive tome of all knowledge regarding Scorekeeper best practices, helpful life lessons, or anything you should take with you if youâ€™re ever trapped on a deserted island. Instead, this document is intended to provide some guidance and helpful reminders for completing your role as a Scorekeeper.

THANK YOU very much from all of us at *FIRST* for volunteering your time and unique skills to guide our events!
