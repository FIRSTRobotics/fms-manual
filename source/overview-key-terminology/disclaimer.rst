Robots can be dangerous. By using the Field Management System (FMS) Software, you understand that in addition to the safety mechanisms built into the software, you, the operator, play a critical part in making sure that the environment around you is safe before enabling robots. You should only enable robots (use the "Match Start" button) when the robots are in a contained area and segregated from humans, who may be injured due to the robot's motion. If you disagree, or are not willing to use the software under these conditions, you should not proceed.
